# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this analysis is to help Beks' foundation to predeict where to make investments. Based on the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we will use the features in the provided dataset (charity_data.csv) to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. For this analysis we are doing the following: 

      1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
      2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
      3: Optimize the Model


# Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
  # Data Preprocessing

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

* What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
